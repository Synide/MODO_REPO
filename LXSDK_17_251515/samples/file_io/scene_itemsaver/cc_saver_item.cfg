  * A Message table allows a command to present a descriptive error without it
  * being hard-coded in the plugin.  Message tables for a command will use a key
  * of the command's server name, followed by a language key, such as .en_US.
  * When a command error is thrown by a plugin, the key for a "T" entry in the message
  * table can be provided, and the command will lookup the correct message to display
  * based on that config entry.
